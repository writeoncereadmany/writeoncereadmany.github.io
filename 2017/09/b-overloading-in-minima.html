            <div class="post-content">
            <p>This is the second in a series of posts on the <a href="https://github.com/writeoncereadmany/minimalang">Minima language</a>. <a href="https://writeoncereadmany.github.io/2017/09/a-minima">Here’s the first</a>.</p>

<p>There are a few things I’ve made a very conscious decision to try to enforce
in the design of Minima.</p>

<p>These include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No nulls/uninitialised state</li>
  <li>No inheritance</li>
  <li>No reflection</li>
  <li>No overloading</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three are simple: I just don’t introduce those features. There’s no
way to define a variable without its initial value: the syntax doesn’t support
it. There’s no concept of classes, let alone subclasses. And there’s no way
to introspect an object or function.</p>

<p>What happens if you try to access an undefined field of an object, you ask?
Not null, that’s for damn sure. You get a type error. At runtime, yes. We’ll
do something better about that later.</p>

<p>Overloading of functions is similarly not supported - any one given name
resolves to exactly one value - but I didn’t just say no overloading of
functions. I’m also concerned about overloading of <em>syntax</em>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>For example, in Java, parens <code class="highlighter-rouge">()</code> are used in two contexts: method invocation and
precedence of (eg arithmetic) sub-expressions. The period <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code> is used in two
contexts: a separator for floating-point numerals, and field/method access on
objects. Angle brackets <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;&gt;</code> are used individually to delimit type arguments,
and also as the less-than and greater-than mathematical operators.</p>

<p>I don’t want to do that. It makes code much simpler and clearer when a given
symbol can only mean one thing. There are four sorts of grouping: arguments,
groups, objects, and precedence - and a standard ASCII keyboard
has three sets of brackets: <code class="highlighter-rouge">{}</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">[]</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">()</code> (excluding <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;&gt;</code>, on the basis
we value <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> higher as mathematical operators).</p>

<p>This gives us two dilemmas. The first is what to use where; the second is we
have more use-cases than tools available.</p>

<p>In terms of what gets first pick of the cherry, there’s a symbology which has
priority over any programming conventions - and that’s maths. Regardless of in what
context we’ll be using whatever language Minima develops into, we’ll need to
support basic arithmetic. That means the basic set of operators: <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">()</code> for precedence. That’s also how parentheses are
used generally (in English): to define subclauses, evaluated in their own right
and then incorporated into the larger context.</p>

<p>More than anything, that’s what readers are used to believing parentheses are <em>for</em>.</p>

<p>That leaves arguments, groups and objects. Groups, or blocks, generally use
one of two syntaxes: <code class="highlighter-rouge">{}</code> in curly-brace languages, and significant whitespace
in languages like Python and Haskell. Objects and classes generally use one of
two syntaxes: <code class="highlighter-rouge">{}</code> in curly-brace languages, and significant whitespace in others.</p>

<p>This makes one decision easy: what to use for arguments. We don’t have anything
competing for <code class="highlighter-rouge">[]</code>, so we can use that there. Generally, languages use <code class="highlighter-rouge">[]</code> for
indexing into arrays, but we don’t have arrays or lists as a language-level
concept.</p>

<p>So let’s get back to <code class="highlighter-rouge">{}</code> - who gets that, groups or objects? Fortunately, there’s
a cool trick here that makes our problem go away. If we define a group as being
a sequence of expressions which are all evaluated, returning the value of the
last expression (which we did), then <em>a group of one expression is equivalent
to a parenthesised expression</em>.</p>

<p>That leaves <code class="highlighter-rouge">{}</code> free for objects.</p>

<p>We don’t want to overload <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code>, and there isn’t really a sensible alternative for
numeric literals, so it’s out for object field access. So we use <code class="highlighter-rouge">:</code> instead.</p>

<h3 id="syntactic-symmetry">Syntactic symmetry</h3>

<p>Now, that means that technically speaking, we have two overloaded sets of symbols.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">[]</code> square brackets can mean something is an <em>argument</em> list or a <em>parameter</em>
list, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">:</code> operator can be used both to <em>define</em> a key-value pair in an
object and to <em>access</em> an object’s field via the key.</p>

<p>In each of these cases, though, whilst they’re distinct syntactic constructs,
they’re symmetrical views on the same concept. Square brackets <code class="highlighter-rouge">[]</code> can be used to
define or invoke a function, but they always refer to the input to a function.
The colon <code class="highlighter-rouge">:</code> can be used to define or access a field, but it’s always defining
how a given value relates to an object.</p>

<p>That’s not an ambiguity. Quite the opposite: it reinforces the syntax.</p>

<h3 id="point-free-programming">Point free programming</h3>

<p>This shortage of bracket types would just go away, if we didn’t need brackets
for function invocation - if we used the point-free style. Haskell doesn’t need
them, so why should we?</p>

<p>Well, let’s take this function as an example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>greet is [] =&gt; println["Hello, World!"]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the point-free style, how would you invoke such a function? It’d just be</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>greet
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And how would you reference such a function to, for example, pass it into
another function as a callback? It’d just be:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>maybeDoSomething[greet]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But when we evaluate <code class="highlighter-rouge">greet</code> to pass it into <code class="highlighter-rouge">maybeDoSomething</code>, that’s an
invocation, right? Or is it? <em>How should the language know?</em></p>

<p>Herein lies the problem. The point free style is fine when there’s no difference
between a function invocation and an uninvoked function, to be invoked later.
There’s a name for that concept: <em>referential transparency</em>, and it’s only true
of pure programming languages.</p>

<p>Haskell is pure: there <em>is no distinction</em> between a zero-arg function and its
result after invoking. Minima is, quite deliberately, not pure.</p>

<p>Whilst I believe purity is an important concept, I have other ideas about how
to deal with it, which will come up as we build atop Minima.</p>

<p>In a language which is not point-free, it’s easy to differentiate between
an invocation of a zero-arg method, and an uninvoked zero-arg method: <code class="highlighter-rouge">greet[]</code>
is an invocation, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">greet</code> is a function.</p>

<p>Plus, the shortage of brackets isn’t really a problem, not since we understood
how parenthesisation can be viewed as a special case of grouping.</p>

<h3 id="maths">Maths!</h3>

<p>One thing you can’t do in Minima is this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>print[2 + 5]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s because there’s no syntactic support for mathematical operators. It’s
not super complicated to add that - and indeed, that’ll be one of the features
we add to Minima in the future. Never fear, though, because we can still do
maths. It’s just not quite as readable:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>print[2:plus[5]]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Numbers are objects, which means they can have fields - and fields can be
methods. Numbers support the following methods: <code class="highlighter-rouge">plus</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">minus</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">multiplyBy</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">divideBy</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">show</code> - which returns a String representation of the number.</p>

<p>They don’t support any comparison operators right at the moment. We’re probably
going to need those, but they open up some interesting questions for another
day.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-equality-and-assignment">A note on equality and assignment</h3>

<p>It’s important not just to avoid overloading syntax, but also to avoid
overloading <em>expectations</em> on syntax.</p>

<p>I get particularly annoyed with the approach taken to the use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code>. Many
languages use <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code> for assignment, which means they end up using <code class="highlighter-rouge">==</code> (and
sometimes even <code class="highlighter-rouge">===</code> too!) for testing for equality.</p>

<p>One language which gets this right is Prolog, where testing for equality and
assignment are just different views on the same operation: unification. It’s
reasonable to use one symbol for one concept! And that’s what lies closest
to the meaning of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code> symbol as used in mathematics: these two things are
conceptually equivalent.</p>

<p>My approach is to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code> for testing for equality (although that’s not
syntactically supported yet, it will be). For assignment, instead, I use <code class="highlighter-rouge">is</code>.
This is, like much of Minima, forward-looking: assignment uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">is</code>, so
<em>re</em>-assignment (not currently supported) can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">becomes</code>, because updating
a variable in-place is fundamentally different to creating a new variable and
deserves distinct syntax.</p>

<p>And that distinct syntax should require more typing, so people have an
opportunity to <em>really think about what they’re doing</em> when they use it.</p>
